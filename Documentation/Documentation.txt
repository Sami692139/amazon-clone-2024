   *************************************    

7. Header routing 
   - create Landing component in src to hold Header, category carosuel , product 
   - so in this case create pages , in the pages create Landing component
   - In Landing components create a function landing.jsx, so render components on it.
   - create another components nameing is Layout for the header binding with child components
   - create one routing for pages to be organized
   - For example http://localhost:5173/cart , cart display without header so cart should be 
         encounter by Layout component
          <LayOut>
            <div>Cart</div>
          </LayOut>
      so cart will be display with header title , Layout component is powerfull 

   - So we go back to header to make Layout, button clike like cart , payment, then 
      on href "/" for amazon home page 
       <a  href ="/order"
       <a  href ="/cart"
   when we click cart display cart page the same order page too
   - To avoid defult refresh  <a href="/" to change Link to
     which is <link to = "/order"

8. Category Routing
   we have four category product each category product has specific product so we want display that , use routing daynamic display it
   - we go back to categoryCard product the '<a href' to change '<link to' 
   - To pass data we use useParams import from react-router-dom
   - declare as a varaible params = useParams()
   - create Api in src to  call  which is productUrl:https://fakestoreapi.com
   - This export in to Result components
   - use axios to get product dynamic which like this:axios.get(${productUrl}/products/category/${categoryName})

   - Get products in a specific category see below link:
     https://fakestoreapi.com/products/category/jewelery

   - create a state to hold value in usestate

9. Detail page Routing part
   - here we go back to product component to do Link to change 
   - On link to passed daynamic which is <Link to={/products/${id}}>
   - The link emarge to routing components the going to productdetail component
     import useParams passed as props 
   - imoprt axios when if we use useEffect 
   - 

10. Laoding Functinality Intergration 
    install react spinner to help loading products: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-loader-spinner
    -React sppner loader: https://www.davidhu.io/react-spinners/storybook/?path=/docs/gridloader--docs
    
    - create loader compoments to use update
     then grap lodder signe to loaded product if don't product dont show it only show loaded products in the cart
     isloading to bind in layou section
     -This Loading component binding to productcd, product, result compomemts

11. Detail page styling and addition of description on a single product
   First step go to productdetail component pass flex style
   This flex pass as props in productCard , if the flex is true , the passed in retuen div as templete style.
    drenderDesc= {true} so we have to distructure 

12. useReducer Hook and useContext API explanation amd example
    - This is for state update available for other component require or provided other components 
   - usestate ans context 
   - if we have complext case we use useReducer than useState
   - dispatch asig to change  render
   - Create one contectProvider component

13. Add to chart functionality
     create utility in src to maintain functionality components like cart add ,price add
      ...state, the three dot is keeping three products
            basket:[...state.basket,action.item]

   then create dataprovider to maintan context which provider data context
   - This dataprovider component create in components 
   we go back to  productcard to create use context


14. Header sticky part implementation
    we go back to header 
    create on section part and css is be sticky
